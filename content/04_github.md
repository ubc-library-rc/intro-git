# GitHub features

GitHub is a great resource for programmers and enthusiasts. Many open-source projects are hosted on Github. Among them, you can find [Linux](https://github.com/torvalds/linux), [Tensorflow](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow), and [Windows Terminal](https://github.com/microsoft/terminal). You can even find the original code for the [Windows Calculator app](https://github.com/microsoft/calculator) on GitHub. 

### Git and Open source community

GitHub hosts millions of open-source projects. With open-source projects, people on different skill levels can work to make technologies more accessible or build meaningful resources for communities. Learning how open-source software is built and maintained can be a great programming class as well.

If you would like to participate in open-source projects on GitHub, October is the perfect month. [Hacktoberfest](https://hacktoberfest.com/) is a month-long celebration of open-source software by DigitalOcean that encourages participation in giving back to the open-source community. Developers get involved by completing pull requests, participating in events, and donating to open-source projects.

GitHub also has many great features that support project development and management. Here, you can find a list of those features and some notes on collaborating with other team members on GitHub.

* **GitHub issues** let you track your work on GitHub. When you mention an issue in another issue or pull-request, the issue's timeline tracks the related work. You can link issues to pull requests.

* **Gist code** is a simple way to share code snippets with others. It is used when you need to share a sample piece of code or technique with your co-workers or friends. To learn more GitHub Gists and how to create them, check out [GitHub Tutorial on Creating Gists](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/editing-and-sharing-content-with-gists/creating-gists)

* **Project management with GitHub** is possible is GitHub offers a card-based project management tool like the one offered by [Trello](https://trello.com/). To begin the setup process, you should click on the **projects** tab in your repository and select **create a project**. GitHub offers templates to organize tasks within the project workflow. You can also set automatic triggers and link them to Github pull requests.

* **GitHub Wiki** is a feature on GitHub to host the documentation of the repository. You can edit wikis directly on GitHub or edit wiki files locally. GitHub Docs give you more information about [Github Wikis](https://docs.github.com/en/communities/documenting-your-project-with-wikis/about-wikis).

* **GitHub Pages** is a static site hosting website that takes HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files straight from a repository on GitHub and publishes a website with them. To learn more about this feature, you can check [GitHub Docs](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/getting-started-with-github-pages/about-github-pages) or the [Introduction to Jekyll](https://ubc-library-rc.github.io/intro-jekyll/) workshop.
