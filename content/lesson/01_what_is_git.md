## What is Version Control

Version control software tracks the changes made to a group of files.  Version control systems like Git are often associated with software development but are increasingly used for collaboration in research and academic environments.  

It takes some discipline to learn and make use of version control but there are many benefits:

* **Collaboration** - Version control helps teams work collaboratively on same set of documents without interfering with each other.
* **Versioning** - It provides a thorough log of changes to tracked files without creating multiple copies, making it easier to identify the most current version.
* **Rolling back** - Made a mistake?  Version control lets you review and undo changes, reverting to previous stages in the document's history. This can be useful when changes to your files introduce unforeseen problems.
* **Understanding context** - Version control can help you understand how the code or writing came to be, who wrote or contributed particular parts, and who you might ask to help understand it better.
* **Backup** - While not meant to be a backup solution, version control systems mean your code and writing can be stored on multiple computers.

## What are Git and GitHub?

**_Git_** and **_GitHub_** are often used interchangeably but it's important to understand what each does and how they work together.

**_Git_** is a free, open source tool that can be installed on your local computer to track changes made to a set of files (referred to as a "git repository" or "repo"). Git can be used independently to organize one's own work, or to coordinate team projects with multiple authors. Git ensures that everyone's contributions are tracked and merged effectivel by keeping copies of all previous versions and documenting the changes, when they were made, and by whom.   


Git was designed for _text_ files that can be opened in a text editor (as opposed to _binary_ file formats like .pdf and .docx).  A Git repository can preserve files of any type, but only text files will benefit from all Git's features.

**_GitHub_** is a popular website for hosting and sharing Git repositories. GitHub provides online infrastructure that makes it easier for teams to collaborate with Git.  Team members make contributions to the repository on local copies of the files, then "push" their changes back to GitHub so everyone else can see them.  The GitHub interface makes it easy to view files in the repository and what changes have been made. GitHub also makes it easier for groups to publish their work (each GitHub repository can have its own project website, blog, and wiki using [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/).)

## Why use version control?
Because no one wants to end up in this familiar place:
